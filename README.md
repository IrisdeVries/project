what features will be exposed to the end user, what problem will be solved for the user
a preliminary sketch of what the application will look like
what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into the right form for your app
what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the problem) and how these should work together
how the platform will facilitate creating your application, and what external components (APIs) you need to make certain features possible
potential problems that may arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these
a very short review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and possibly technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)
